# Cpp-Course
Code from course on my studies. Mostly OOP programms. And small projects, BigInt and Wave

Most important directories are BigInt, Wave and project_BMP. BigInt is a structure handling Big Integer numbers that gives possibilitiy to do calculations on really big numbers. Wave is reading .obj files and creating 2D visualization in .bmp files which are created using calsses from project_BMP.

Other scripts are some exercises from laboratories and "Thinking in C++" book and also some implementations of data structures, which some where written in C also.
